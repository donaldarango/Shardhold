### IMPORTANT ###
List critical instructions for playing the game.
The tutorials should explain most of the gameplay and hopefully answer any questions, but just to clarify a few things:
You must hit the turn timer to end your turn or let it run out.
You cannot place Traps or Structures in tiles already occupied by an Enemy.
You are allowed to discard a single card once a round for a new one.
Ally Cards remain in your hand until the ally loses all its health in battle.

-TIPS IF YOU GET STUCK-
If you're struggling on the final, full gameplay level then make sure to utilize traps and structures as well as your one discard a turn to maximize your card usage.

-GAME BREAKING BUGS-
None at the moment.
