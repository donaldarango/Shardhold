### CONTROLS<br/>
The entire game is played through the mouse.<br/>
Hover over tiles with your cursor to see card ranges and enemy, structure, or trap information.<br/>
Left click to select a card.<br/>
Right click to deselect a currently selected card.<br/>
Once a card is selected, hover over a valid tile for that card and left click again to play it.<br/>
If you wish to discard a card, you may select the card you want to discard then hit the discard button once per turn.<br/>
ESC opens the pause menu where you can save, load, quit, or go to settings to lower the volume.<br/>
Once done with your turn, select the turn timer to begin the enemy phase. Once the enemy phase concludes, it will be the player turn again.<br/>

### IMPORTANT<br/>
The tutorials should explain most of the gameplay and hopefully answer any questions, but just to clarify a few things:<br/>
You must hit the turn timer to end your turn or let it run out.<br/>
You cannot place Traps or Structures in tiles already occupied by an Enemy.<br/>
You are allowed to discard a single card once a round for a new one.<br/>
Ally Cards remain in your hand until the ally loses all its health in battle.<br/>

### TIPS IF YOU GET STUCK<br/>
If you're struggling on the final, full gameplay level then make sure to utilize traps and structures as well as your one discard a turn to maximize your card usage.
